You need setuptools installed to install pakage.

```
pip install setuptools
```

If setuptools already installed, ust run command below in root dir, to install rolefr-plugins.

```
pip install .
```

To upgrade pakage, run:

```
pip install --upgrade .
```

To delete pakage simply run:

Installation process uses legacy way to build pakage, so it needs to be updated.
